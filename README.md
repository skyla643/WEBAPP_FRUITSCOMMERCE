# 🍊 Citrus Argentina Web App Development Log  
**🗓️ March 28, 2025 — Progress Recap**

## ✅ What We Completed Today

### 🔐 Authentication & Routing
- Integrated a **fully functional login screen** as the initial page using React Router.
- Connected login logic to the dashboard successfully.
- Set up routing tabs: `Dashboard`, `Orchards`, `Pest Detection`, `Supply Chain`, `Market Data`.

### 🧭 Navigation & Layout
- Created a clean **persistent navigation bar** featuring:
  - Company name: **Citrus Argentina**
  - Welcome message (e.g., "Welcome, test1234")
  - All tab links (highlighting current tab)
  - Logout button
- Ensured the navbar stays consistent across all internal pages.

### 🌿 Orchards Page (Finalized)
- Matched the design to the Figma/screenshot **exactly**:
  - Clean card layout for each orchard
  - Titles: `Salta Estate`, `Tucumán Valley`
  - Subtitles with location: `Salta Province`, `Tucumán Province`
  - Icons for:
    - 🌧️ **Soil Moisture** (WiRaindrop)
    - 🌡️ **Temperature** (WiThermometer)
  - Date of last update with formatted timestamp
- Fully responsive and visually polished.
- Fixed JSX component error by importing weather icons properly.

### 🎨 Visual & Branding
- Matched color palette (earth green, soft gray, white background, orange accents).
- Used Tailwind CSS with custom color classes (`bg-earthGreen`, `text-accentOrange`, etc.).
- Applied clean drop shadows and consistent spacing.

## 🛠️ Bugs Fixed / Issues Resolved

- 🐞 **Login route not showing**: Now loads first before dashboard.
- 🐞 **Weather Icons (WiRaindrop, WiThermometer)** TypeScript error: Fixed by importing them correctly and ensuring they're valid JSX components.
- 🐞 **Routing issues**: Verified and fixed navigation for all dashboard tabs.
- ✅ **Compiled without warnings/errors** (final build clean!).

---

## ⏸️ Where We Stopped

- The **Orchards** tab is **complete and finalized.**
- Other tabs (`Pest Detection`, `Supply Chain`, `Market Data`) are linked but contain placeholder data or are empty.
- Login is visually working, but authentication logic can be enhanced later with state management.

## 🚀 What We’ll Do Tomorrow (March 29th)

1. **Finalize Pest Detection tab**
   - Create cards with pest alerts, location, severity indicators
   - Match the style of Orchards (icons, visuals, and updates)

2. **Complete Supply Chain tab**
   - Show active shipments, ETA, unit counts
   - Possibly add tracking bar/stepper component

3. **Build Market Data tab**
   - Include mock charts (line/bar) for citrus prices and export trends
   - Add dropdowns for filtering data by region or time period

4. **Enhance Login**
   - Add proper state authentication (possibly use React Context or simple auth logic)

5. **Polish UI/UX**
   - Animate cards subtly (with Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions)
   - Optimize for mobile
   - Add hover states, tooltips, and minor visual flare

6. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Production build setup (`npm run build`)
   - Choose deployment (GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify)
   - Set up custom domain if needed

## 🧠 Notes

- The UI now closely mirrors the Figma design + screenshots provided.
- All development is being done in **React + TypeScript** using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Components are modular, easy to scale.
