‚úÖ Immediate Next Steps (March 19, 2025)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Resolve remaining import errors clearly and decisively

	‚Ä¢	/api/products
	‚Ä¢	/api/orchard
	‚Ä¢	/api/supply-chain
	‚Ä¢	/api/eco

3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement & Style Components
	‚Ä¢	Fully develop and refine each frontend component to render real data fetched from your API.
	‚Ä¢	Apply Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look:
	‚Ä¢	Dashboard layout
	‚Ä¢	Seasonal fruit details
	‚Ä¢	Orchard sensor data visualizations
	‚Ä¢	Commodity information cards
	‚Ä¢	Supply chain tracking visualization
	‚Ä¢	Eco-friendly metrics and calculator
	‚Ä¢	Product authentication check interface (simulated blockchain)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Debugging
	‚Ä¢	Confirm all components render backend data without issues.
