# Citrus Argentina Web App

## Overview

The Citrus Argentina Web App is being built in a beta-to-production pipeline. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend:** Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Built with Express, REST APIs, and WebSocket support (not yet fully integrated in the beta).

Our current focus has been on creating a static version of the beta site that showcases the intended design and layout using placeholder data. This static site will be used for stakeholder review and can later be updated with live data and additional functionality.

## What We Did Today

### 1. **Production Build & Static Site Creation**
- **React App Production Build:**
  - Ran `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder to generate the production build.
  - The build output (HTML, CSS, JS, and assets) was generated in `frontend/build`.
- **Static Site Setup:**
  - Created a new folder named `citrus-argentina-site` within our repository.
  - Copied the contents of `frontend/build` into `citrus-argentina-site` to serve as our static, deployable site.
- **Local Testing:**
  - Used Python’s built-in HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server 5001`) to verify the static site works locally.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS Customization**
- **Updated `tailwind.config.js`:**
  - **Colors:** Added custom colors (`earthGreen`, `brandYellow`, and `accentOrange`) to match the new design.
  - **Font Family:** Replaced the default font with `"Montserrat"` for a modern, clean look.
  - **Spacing & Shadows:** Introduced additional spacing values (`72`, `84`, `96`) and a custom box shadow (`custom-light`) for refined card layouts and enhanced visual depth.
- These changes are aimed at aligning the visual design of the beta site with the polished look provided in our design documents.

### 3. **File and Folder Management**
- Moved and organized files properly within our repository:
  - Ensured that the production build output is in the `citrus-argentina-site` folder.
  - Verified the file structure using terminal commands, ensuring a clean and modular layout.

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### 1. **Design Refinement**
- **HTML & CSS Updates:**
  - Refactor the HTML components to fully incorporate the new Tailwind classes and custom styles.
  - Update navigation, headers, cards, and sections to match the final design as per the PDFs.
- **Responsive Adjustments:**
  - Fine-tune responsive breakpoints and add subtle hover/transition effects for a smoother user experience.

### 2. **Prepare for Backend Integration**
- **Placeholder Markup:**
  - Mark placeholder data with `data-*` attributes or comments, making future integration with live API data easier.
- **API Hookup Preparation:**
  - Plan how and where to integrate backend calls for dynamic content (authentication, real-time updates, etc.).

### 3. **Deployment Planning**
- **Static Site Deployment:**
  - Finalize the process for deploying the static site (e.g., GitHub Pages using a `gh-pages` branch or a `docs` folder).
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Outline steps for setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline to streamline future updates.

## How This Helps Reach Our End Goal

- **Foundation for a Production-Ready Site:**
  - By converting our React production build into a static site, we have a stable, testable version of the app’s interface.
- **Visual Alignment:**
  - The updated Tailwind configuration and file structure now closely reflect our intended final design, ensuring consistency across the project.
- **Streamlined Future Integration:**
  - With placeholders and modular components in place, future work (like backend integration and user authentication) can be added incrementally without disrupting the current design.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:**
  - Presenting a polished, static site helps secure buy-in from stakeholders while providing a clear roadmap for moving to a fully functional, live environment.

## Running the Site Locally

To test the static site on your local machine, run the following commands:

```bash
cd /Users/skyla/Documents/GitHub/ca-webapp-or-citrus-argentina-webapp/citrus-argentina-site
python3 -m http.server 5001

Then open http://localhost:5001 in your browser.

Deployment

For deployment, consider the following options:
	•	GitHub Pages:
	•	Use the gh-pages branch or move your static site folder to a docs folder in the repository.
	•	Other Static Hosting:
	•	Services like Netlify or Vercel can also host the static site easily.
	•	CI/CD:
	•	Set up a pipeline to automate builds and deployments as the project evolves.

Conclusion

Today, we successfully generated a production build of our React app and transformed it into a static site with an updated design using custom Tailwind CSS configurations. This achievement sets a strong foundation for integrating live data and backend features in the coming days. Tomorrow, we’ll focus on refining the design details, making responsive adjustments, and preparing the site for dynamic backend integration to move us closer to our end goal: a fully functional, production-ready Citrus Argentina Web App.

Happy coding, and see you tomorrow for the next steps!
