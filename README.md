## What We’ve Done So Far

- **Beta UI/UX Implementation:**  
  - Added a responsive navigation bar with anchor links.
  - Implemented a gradient header (earth green to yellow) with a prominent title.
  - Created sections for Dashboard, Commodity Profile, Eco-Friendly Farming Calculator, Orchard Monitoring, Product Authentication, Seasonal Fruit Availability, and Supply Chain Tracker.
  - Added dummy data to each component to simulate real content.
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
  - Configured React, TypeScript, and Webpack (via Create React App or custom configuration) to compile successfully and run on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **GitHub & Version Control:**  
  - The project is structured for GitHub with separate folders for backend and frontend.
  - A base TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.base.json`) is used alongside the frontend’s own configuration.

## How to Run the Beta Locally

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

	2.	Start the Development Server:
Run:

npm start

The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Next Steps Toward a Fully Functional Website

While the beta is nearly complete for presentation purposes, here are the key steps we plan to take to move from beta to a production-ready site:
	1.	Integrate Real Data:
	•	Backend API Connection:
Replace dummy data in each component with real API calls to the backend.

	3.	Functionality & Feature Expansion:
	•	User Authentication:
Implement login, registration, and secure user sessions.
	•	Real-time Data Updates:
Set up WebSocket or polling for real-time dashboard updates.
	•	Advanced Component Features:
Expand components (e.g., supply chain tracking, orchard monitoring) with detailed charts, filters, and reports.
	4.	Testing & Quality Assurance:
	•	Unit & Integration Tests:
Write tests for all critical components using Jest and React Testing Library.
	•	End-to-End Testing:
Set up automated E2E tests with Cypress or a similar framework.
	5.	Deployment Preparations:
	•	Build Optimization:
Optimize the production build (e.g., code splitting, minification).
	•	CI/CD Pipeline:
Configure continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
	•	Domain & Hosting:
Plan for hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS) and secure a domain name.
	6.	Documentation & User Guides:
	•	User Documentation:
Write a user manual or help section explaining how to use the website.
	•	Developer Documentation:
Update README and add inline documentation for future developers.

# Citrus Argentina Web App – Documentation (March 22, 2025)

This document provides a detailed summary of our work today, what we accomplished, and our roadmap for moving from a beta version to a fully functional production website.

---

## 1. Initial Challenges and Resolutions

### File Structure and Import Errors
- **Issue:** We encountered errors such as:
  - "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './App' in .../frontend/src"
  - "File not found: /backend/frontend/src/index.tsx"
- **Resolution:**
  - We confirmed that the actual React project lives in the `frontend` folder at the root level.
  - We removed the duplicate and unused `/backend/frontend` folder.
  - We adjusted our import paths in `index.tsx` and verified that files such as `index.css`, `App.tsx`, and `reportWebVitals.ts` are correctly located in `frontend/src`.

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Issue:** There were two TypeScript configuration files:
  - `/tsconfig.json` (project-wide) and `/frontend/tsconfig.json` (frontend-specific).
- **Resolution:**
  - We renamed the project-wide configuration to `tsconfig.base.json` to avoid conflicts.
  - The frontend now uses its own `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript settings.

### Package Installation and Build Issues
- We installed several development packages (e.g., `ts-loader`, `style-loader`, `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, and `typescript`).
- After resolving these issues, the project compiled successfully, and we could run it locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Beta UI/UX Implementation

### Overview of the Beta UI
- **Header:**  
  - The header uses an earth green background (`#556B2F`) with a prominent yellow title (`#FFD700`) reading “Beta UI/UX Showcase.”
- **Navigation & Sections:**  
  - Although our current beta does not yet include a fully functional navigation bar, our beta version displays each main component as separate sections.
  - The sections include:
    - Dashboard
    - Commodity Profile
    - Eco-Friendly Farming Calculator
    - Orchard Monitoring Dashboard
    - Product Authentication
    - Seasonal Fruit Availability
    - Supply Chain Tracker
- **Component Layout:**  
  - Each component is styled with dummy data that reflects the planned structure and uses Tailwind CSS classes (with custom inline style tweaks for earth tones and accents).
- **Footer:**  
  - The footer uses a vibrant orange background (`#FFA500`) with white text.

### How It Was Implemented
- **React Components:**  
  - Created reusable components for each section inside `/frontend/src/components/`.
  - The main application in `App.tsx` imports these components and arranges them in a scrollable page.
- **Styling:**  
  - Global styles are applied through `index.css` (using Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling) and component-specific styles via `App.css`.
  - The color scheme was adjusted to incorporate earth green, yellow, and orange.
- **Dummy Data:**  
  - Each component currently displays hard-coded (dummy) data so that stakeholders can see a near-final visual mockup.

6. Conclusion

Today, we transformed the project from a state of file path and configuration issues into a working beta UI/UX that closely resembles a near-complete website. While the beta currently uses dummy data, we now have a solid foundation to integrate real data and advanced functionality in the coming weeks.

This document serves as a guide for what has been done and a roadmap for our next steps. Please refer back to this file as we continue to evolve the Citrus Argentina web app from beta to production-ready.
