Citrus Argentina Web App - Development Progress

üõ†Ô∏è Progress Overview (March 14, 2025)

Today, we made significant progress in setting up and refining the backend for the Citrus Argentina web application. Here‚Äôs what we accomplished:

‚úÖ Completed Today:
	1.	Backend Initialization & Setup
	‚Ä¢	Installed required dependencies (express, passport, session, dotenv, ws, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Created the Express server in server.ts and set up middleware.
	‚Ä¢	Enabled WebSocket functionality for real-time updates.
	2.	Authentication Routes & Controllers
	‚Ä¢	Created authRoutes.ts and authController.ts to handle user registration and login.
	‚Ä¢	Implemented a simple in-memory user storage (to be replaced with a database later).
	‚Ä¢	Successfully tested user registration with curl commands.
	3.	Orchard Monitoring Routes & Controllers
	‚Ä¢	Set up orchardRoutes.ts and orchardController.ts to fetch orchard data.
	‚Ä¢	Created a sample response structure for orchard monitoring.
	4.	Product API Setup
	‚Ä¢	Identified missing productRoutes.ts and productController.ts.
	‚Ä¢	Created productController.ts and moved it to the correct location in backend/src/controllers/.
	‚Ä¢	Checked for missing imports in server.ts.
	5.	Debugging & Fixes
	‚Ä¢	Fixed EADDRINUSE error by terminating duplicate server instances.
	‚Ä¢	Resolved missing route imports (authRoutes, orchardRoutes).
	‚Ä¢	Confirmed correct API responses for authentication and orchard data.

üöÄ Next Steps for Tomorrow (March 15, 2025)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Complete API Routes & Controllers
	‚Ä¢	Finish and implement productRoutes.ts, ecoRoutes.ts, and supplyChainRoutes.ts.
	‚Ä¢	Remove blockchain authentication from the project.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Backend to Frontend
	‚Ä¢	Initialize the frontend with React & TypeScript.
	‚Ä¢	Set up API calls to connect React components with backend endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Test GET and POST requests from the frontend.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging & Local Testing
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all API endpoints are accessible and returning expected responses.
	‚Ä¢	Check WebSocket functionality for real-time updates.
	‚Ä¢	Validate that the frontend correctly renders API data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare for Beta Testing
	‚Ä¢	Refine API documentation for easy testing.
	‚Ä¢	Review UI/UX to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.
	‚Ä¢	Start planning for deployment (optional).
