# 🍊 Citrus Argentina Web App Development Log

🗓️ March 28 – April 8, 2025 — Progress Recap & System Recovery

---

## ✅ What We Completed

### 🔐 Authentication & Routing
- Login and Signup pages designed with custom citrus-themed UI using Tailwind CSS.
- Routing set up via React Router for all main sections:
  - `/` (Login)
  - `/signup`
  - `/dashboard`
  - `/orchards`
  - `/pest-detection`
  - `/supply-chain`
  - `/market-data`
  - `/clients`

### 🧭 Navigation & Layout
- Login and Signup forms:
  - Embedded welcome messages and citrus animations (🍋).
  - Background video on login for immersive entry experience.
  - Glassmorphism form design with responsive layout.
- Linked between pages using React Router’s `<Link />`.

### 🎨 Visual & Branding
- Color palette: 🍊 oranges, 🍋 yellows, 🍃 greens, light white overlays.
- Fonts: Montserrat + Inter + Poppins used for modern branding tone.
- Social login icons (Google, LinkedIn, Twitter) integrated using `react-icons`.

### 🛠️ Bugs Fixed / Issues Resolved
- 💥 Recovered from multiple major visual regressions during loading screen testing.
- ❌ Removed broken loading screen code and restored original `App.tsx` routing.
- 🔧 Fixed `tailwind.config.js` which had multiple conflicting exports.
- 🧼 Cleaned up global CSS and restored full styling on login + signup pages.
- ✔️ Final visual pass matched screenshot designs exactly.

### 💡 Developer Productivity Tools
- Created a dedicated `LoadingPreview.tsx` to test animations.
- Setup dev-mode toggle to simulate page loads with optional loading screen.
- Terminal-based video asset placement tested for future page video loops.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- React Icons can produce TS2786 errors if improperly used (ensure they return valid JSX).
- Global styling issues often stem from `tailwind.config.js` or broken import orders.
- Small visual tweaks can deeply impact layout — always back up before testing major animations.

## 🚧 What’s Next?

- [ ] Revisit animations & transitions — with proper test routing preview
- [ ] Add backend auth logic (email/password auth + user roles)
- [ ] Finalize dashboard pages: Pest Detection, Market Data, and Supply Chain
- [ ] Deploy production build (`npm run build` + hosting)
- [ ] Begin user role management (clients vs. staff vs. admin)
