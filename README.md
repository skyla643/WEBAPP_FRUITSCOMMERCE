# Citrus Argentina Beta Website

**Date:** March 22, 2025

## Overview

This repository contains the beta version of the Citrus Argentina web app. The project is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Our current beta version includes a fully navigable user interface with placeholder (dummy) data that demonstrates the planned sections and functionality of the final product.

## What We’ve Done So Far

- **Beta UI/UX Implementation:**  
  - Added a responsive navigation bar with anchor links.
  - Implemented a gradient header (earth green to yellow) with a prominent title.
  - Created sections for Dashboard, Commodity Profile, Eco-Friendly Farming Calculator, Orchard Monitoring, Product Authentication, Seasonal Fruit Availability, and Supply Chain Tracker.
  - Added dummy data to each component to simulate real content.
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
  - Configured React, TypeScript, and Webpack (via Create React App or custom configuration) to compile successfully and run on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **GitHub & Version Control:**  
  - The project is structured for GitHub with separate folders for backend and frontend.
  - A base TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.base.json`) is used alongside the frontend’s own configuration.

## How to Run the Beta Locally

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

	2.	Start the Development Server:
Run:

npm start

The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Next Steps Toward a Fully Functional Website

While the beta is nearly complete for presentation purposes, here are the key steps we plan to take to move from beta to a production-ready site:
	1.	Integrate Real Data:
	•	Backend API Connection:
Replace dummy data in each component with real API calls to the backend.
	•	Data Models & Validation:
Implement TypeScript interfaces and validation to ensure data integrity.
	2.	Enhanced UI/UX Improvements:
	•	Design Refinements:
Refine colors, typography, and spacing based on stakeholder feedback.
	•	Responsive Enhancements:
Further test and adjust responsive breakpoints to optimize for all devices.
	•	User Interactions:
Add animations, transitions, and interactive elements as needed.
	3.	Functionality & Feature Expansion:
	•	User Authentication:
Implement login, registration, and secure user sessions.
	•	Real-time Data Updates:
Set up WebSocket or polling for real-time dashboard updates.
	•	Advanced Component Features:
Expand components (e.g., supply chain tracking, orchard monitoring) with detailed charts, filters, and reports.
	4.	Testing & Quality Assurance:
	•	Unit & Integration Tests:
Write tests for all critical components using Jest and React Testing Library.
	•	End-to-End Testing:
Set up automated E2E tests with Cypress or a similar framework.
	5.	Deployment Preparations:
	•	Build Optimization:
Optimize the production build (e.g., code splitting, minification).
	•	CI/CD Pipeline:
Configure continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
	•	Domain & Hosting:
Plan for hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS) and secure a domain name.
	6.	Documentation & User Guides:
	•	User Documentation:
Write a user manual or help section explaining how to use the website.
	•	Developer Documentation:
Update README and add inline documentation for future developers.
